/// Walks across the application and make screenshots for documentation.
///
/// ## How to make screenshots
///
/// - Just select the *DesignToolboxUITests* scheme and the device you want.
/// - Ensure you already installed the app in debug mode and select the theme you want
/// - The screenshots won't override the color scheme, so yo should make two runs of the tests: one in light mode, one in dark mode.
/// - Run the UI tests
///
/// Maybe in the future we should move to [Fastlane snapshot](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/snapshot/), however running Fastlane
/// and launching from CLI the simulators is slow and heavy.
///
/// ## Which screenshots to do
///
/// The following screenshots must be done for:
/// - button (all themes, in one image light and dark declinations)
///
/// ## How to find screenshots
///
/// Screenshots can be found in tests attachements.
/// You can pick them in tests reports.
/// Then get the screenshots in attachments ; base name of the files are the ones defined in the tests.
